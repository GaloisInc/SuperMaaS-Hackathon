## SuperMaaS Hackathon June 16-17, 2020

The SuperMaaS Hackathon for the World Modelers program will be held virtually on June 16th and 17th.  Check back soon
for additional details on the meeting.

The purpose of this meeting is to work with bottom-up modelers on the process of model registry with the initial pre-alpha release of SuperMaaS.  We will be providing context for the current tools we have built for this process, and working directly with domain modelers to attempt to register their models, recording all information gained whether the process succeeds or fails.

Input from domain modelers and hands on experience with their models is crucial to ensuring success as we continue our engineering efforts.  Please register via the link at the top of this page with details on your model if you would like to participate in this project as a bottom-up modeler.  The Hackathon will involve a series of concurrent 1:1 sessions which focus on a particular domain model for the registry process, enabling our engineers to work with closely modelers.

## FAQ

* **Q:** Who is this hackathon designed to support?
* **A:** The primary target of this hackathon are bottom-up modelers in the World Modelers program seeking to better understand the Model Registry process of SuperMaaS.  This includes any and all modelers who wish to make their models available to analysts through the CauseMos interface being developed by Uncharted.

* **Q:** What will the primary focus of the Hackathon be?
* **A:** The Hackathon will consist of plenary sessions where general details of SuperMaaS will be discussed and demoed, and a series of 1:1 model registry sessions.  In these sessions we will work with a focus group of modelers in break-out virtual rooms to attempt hands-on registry of their models in this pre-alpha version of SuperMaaS.

* **Q:** What outcomes do we expect out of this Hackathon?
* **A:** In the ideal world, the Hackathon will result in the registration of a number of new modelers in the SuperMaaS system.  Since this is a very early prototype, we will be using terminal capture utilities to better understand and record the process of model preparation, calibration, and configuration, as well as the procedures for model execution and output understanding.  These recorded sessions will then be leveraged by our engineers to improve the SuperMaaS system and better understand how to successfully register a larger subset of domain models.
